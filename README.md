# BG-Sniper
==================================================

 An image background eraser tool I built using html. Hope it helps you somewhere down the line.ðŸ˜Ž

 Use the sliders in the settings section to adjust background erase function. (Solid Color BG: Lower Number, Gradient Color BG: Higher Numbers) 

 Code is open source and free to be used as you see fit. Just please give credit.
 
 Clone the repo here: https://github.com/Recoverrrr/BG-Sniper.git
 
 It can be downloaded and ran by running index.html or you can visit www.bgsniper.xyz to use the program.
